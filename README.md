# juce_jif

Juce module for loading and playing back GIF files, essentially just a juce module wrapper for [@dingari](https://github.com/dingari)'s [gist](https://gist.github.com/dingari/ba54e0208c9eb6919811784cc7264e33), with the option to add a listener for when the gif has finished playing. 
It depends on [gif_load](https://github.com/hidefromkgb/gif_load) which I've just added to the root dir of the module.

(@dingari thanks for posting the gist, you're a lifesaver)
